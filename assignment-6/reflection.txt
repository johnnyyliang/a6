## Reflection questions

1. For TODO 1, briefly explain how you constructed your graph. Did you discover
   the maze via a BFS/DFS search, or did you iterate directly over the tile grid
   to locate edges? Why did you choose this approach?
   
   Answer: TODO

2. In the original Pac-Man game, a piece of fruit appeared at a predetermined 
   position on the board once Pac-Man had eaten 70 dots and remained on the screen 
   for 9 seconds. Eating this fruit awarded the player a score bonus. Describe how 
   you could add this feature to your PacMann game. Which files, fields, or methods 
   would you need to edit / add? 

   Answer: TODO

(Answer RQ3 only if you completed the challenge extension, otherwise delete it.)

3. In a couple of sentences, explain the strategy employed by your PacMannAI.
